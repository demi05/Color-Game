A simple and fun color guessing game built using React. The game challenges you to guess the correct color based on a randomly generated color displayed in a box. The game tests your speed and accuracy as you make color selections.

2. You are presented with multiple color options, including the target color.
3. Correct guesses reward you with points.
4. You have 3 lives throughout the entire game session.
5. After 3 wrong guesses, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
6. A "New Game" button allows you to restart the game anytime.

**How to Play**
1. The game will display a box with a random color.
2. You need to select the button that matches the color in the box.
3. Each correct guess increases your score by 1.
4. If you make a wrong guess, your remaining lives decrease by 1.
